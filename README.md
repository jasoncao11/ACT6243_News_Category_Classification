## Note    
The goal of this Lab is to explore some of the main scikit-learn tools on a single practical task: analyzing a collection of text documents (newsgroups posts) on twenty different topics.
In this Lab we will see how to:   

1. Load the file contents and the categories    
2. Extract feature vectors suitable for machine learning   
3. Training a classifier   
4. Building a pipeline    
5. Parameter tuning using grid search   
6. Evaluation of the performance on the test set
